          <h1 class="work h1"> Cash Management Officer, <strong>NCBA BANK KENYA PLC.</strong></h1>
          <p>I spearheaded the implementation and end-to-end testing of the NCBA ConnectPlus system, a corporate internet banking platform designed to improve client cash flow visibility, transaction efficiency, and overall user experience. Working closely with product teams, IT, and operations, I validated the functionality, security, and performance of critical modules such as payment processing, account reconciliation, liquidity management, and user onboarding.

As part of this role, I executed and documented comprehensive User Acceptance Testing (UAT) plans, identified system issues, and provided actionable feedback to ensure a seamless go-live. I also supported client onboarding and training initiatives, driving adoption of ConnectPlus and promoting digital self-service in line with NCBA’s innovation strategy.

Additionally, I contributed to the development of internal testing protocols and helped optimize operational workflows through a tech-driven and client-centric approach. My efforts were instrumental in increasing channel uptake and utilization—both by onboarding new-to-bank customers and by strengthening relationships with existing clients through proactive support, cross-selling, and attrition management—leading to a measurable increase in Non-Funded Income (NFI).

By maintaining smooth and regular operations between cash management and customers, I ensured that the platform not only delivered on its promise of efficiency but also enhanced client trust and satisfaction.</p>

          <h1 class="work h1"> Human Resources Intern, <strong>LOOP DFS</strong></h1>
          <p>During my experience in Human Resources, I have actively contributed to 
            building a positive and inclusive workplace culture. I supported the HR team
             in key areas such as talent acquisition, onboarding, and employee engagement, 
             ensuring smooth processes and meaningful employee experiences. I collaborated 
             on the development and implementation of well-being and professional growth programs,
            fostering a culture of continuous learning and support across the organization.
            To strengthen engagement, I conducted regular employee surveys and feedback initiatives, 
            helping to identify organizational needs and shape effective culture-related strategies. 
            I also participated in diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, contributing to initiatives 
            that promoted fairness, belonging, and respect in the workplace.
            Additionally, I assisted in performance management processes, from setting up review frameworks
            to aligning goals with broader organizational objectives. I also provided support in managing 
            employee relations, addressing conflicts, handling grievances, and fostering a harmonious and 
            collaborative work environment.</p>
